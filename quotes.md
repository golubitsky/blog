—Ruskin, _The Elements of Drawing_ (p. 27)

> To play much better — that's all I'm interested in; so I teach. And as the eldest member of the class that also says that I'm the dumbest, because I've been in the class the longest. I'm teaching right now so that somebody might luckily come up and show me the right thing and then when they show it to me I'm gonna forget about teaching and everything; see, I'll graduate from the class then.

—Barry Harris, ~20 minutes into [Passing It On — a musical portrait of Barry Harris, jazz pianist and teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEgdp9bM9qU)

> It is an evil when the drama of a life does not continue in others for reason of their deafness or ignorance.

—James P. Carse, _Finite and Infinite Games_ (p. 32)

> CS folks have long sought "high level coding" as a way of expressing something that clearly begs expressing. I find that I can use simple C to frame out even the grandest concepts. It should be concrete, yet general.

> \[Alan\] Kay taught us that good design form reflects human mental models.

—James Coplien, LinkedIn post, 2022-02-09 (I found [Alan Kay's Scientific American article](http://worrydream.com/refs/Kay%20-%20Computer%20Software%20-%20SciAm.pdf) and [Alan Kay's list of old books new programmers should read](https://www.quora.com/Experienced-programmers-and-computer-scientists-what-are-some-really-old-or-even-nearly-forgotten-books-you-think-every-new-programmer-should-read/answer/Alan-Kay-11?share=1))

> I don't want to work on a team ever again that doesn't do test-driven development day to day; it's by far the most effective practice that's surfaced during my time as a software developer.

—Dave Farley, [Martin Fowler On The Fundamentals Of Software Development, The Engineering Room Ep. 1, 1:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TwoubGSXpc&t=3848)

> For most of the kind of commercial software that we work on at ThoughtWorks, TDD is an essential.

—Martin Fowler, same as previous quote

> Clean code honors the deep roots of wisdom beneath our broader culture, or our culture as it once was, or should be, and _can_ be with attentiveness to detail.

> You should name a variable using the same care with which you name a first-born child.

> Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care—not just of any great method that descends from the heavens. That these acts are simple doesn't mean that they are simplistic, and it hardly means that they are easy. They are nonetheless the fabric of greatness and, more so, of beauty, in any human endeavor. To ignore them is not yet to be fully human.

—James Coplien, forward to _Clean Code_ by Robert Martin (pp. xxi and xxii)

> We're in the business of producing side effects, but we should not use side effects as the tools to do our work.

—Russ Olsen, [Expert Talk: Functional Programming • Russ Olsen & Christian Romney • GOTO 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbCWHZljhkM&list=PLEx5khR4g7PJozVmHNpQTVrk1QRC7YaJu) [t=476](https://youtu.be/AbCWHZljhkM?t=476)

> If you can't trust you teammates to make changes carefully, then your version control system is not going to fix that for you. The real answer is to figure out how to make your colleages more trustworthy.

—Dave Farley, [You NEED To Stop Using Pull Requests](https://youtu.be/ASOSEiJCyEM?t=745)

> When we do read code, we find that some of it gets written because of machine limitations, some because of language limitations, some because of programmer limitations, some because of historical accidents, and some because of specifications--both essential and inessential.

—Gerald M. Weinberg, _The Psychology of Computer Programming_, p. 13

> As is usual with programming disasters, nobody recognized it as such."

—Gerald M. Weinberg, The Psychology of Computer Programming, p. 17

> Bertrand Russell wrote in _The Philosophy of Logical Atomism_ that "Everything is vague to a degree you do not realise till you have tried to make it precise." On most projects event today, writing code is the first time that we try to make the solution really precise.

—Gojko Adzic, _Bridging the Communication Gap_, p. 12

> I think we have a social responsibility to make a lean world that's broadly contributing to the value of society rather than a few individuals here and there.

—James Coplien, [Scaling Agile: The Small-is-Beautiful of Hubs • James Coplien • GOTO 2021](https://youtu.be/Va8QedfiC9k?t=2783)

> Working from specifications does not guarantee that the project will deliver the desired business value.

—Gojko Adzic, _Bridging the Communication Gap_, p. 15

> As formality increases, tests and requirements become indistinguishable. At the limit, tests and requirements are equivalent.

—Robert C. Martin, Grigori Melnik [Tests and Requirements, Requirements and Tests: A Möbius Strip](http://gmelnik.com/papers/Melnik-Martin-Tests-and-Requirements-The-Moebius-Strip-IEEE-Software-2008.pdf), quoted by Gojko Adzic, _Bridging the Communication Gap_, p. 26

> Especially whatever is floating, inconspicuous, or fleeting reveals itself only to deep, contemplative attention. Likewise, it is only contemplative lingering that has access to phenomena that are long and slow. Paul Cézanne, a master of deep, contemplative attention, once remarked that he could _see_ the fragrance of things. This visualization of fragrances requires profound attention. In the contemplative state, one steps outside oneself, so to speak, and immerses oneself in the surroundings. Merleau-Ponty describes Cézanne's mode of contemplatively observing a landscape as a kind of externalization or de-interiorization: "He would start by discovering the geological structure of the landscape; then, according to Mme Cézanne, he would halt and gaze, eyes dilated. . . . "The landscape thinks itself in me," he said, "and I am its consciousness."

—Byung-Chul Han, _The Burnout Society_ ("Profound Boredom", p. 14)

> Q: What is your favourite colour?<br>
> A: General harmony.

—Paul Cézanne, from "A questionnaire, _Mes Confidences_", _Cézanne by himself_ edited by Richard Kendall (p. 31)

> Teams often consider requirements as something carved in stone that has to match exactly what customers demand. In fact, customers will often accept a different solution if it solves the problem, especially if it is a lot cheaper and easier to implement.

—Gojko Adzic, _Bridging the Communication Gap_, pp. 30-31

> Often the original proponent of a theory or technique understands its promise, its liabilities, and its proper domain more clearly than his later disciples. Less gifted, more fervent, their very fervor leads to rigidity, misapplication, oversimplification.

—Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., _The Design of Design_, p. 31

> Do not try to imitate the old masters. Seek what they sought.

—Matsuo Basho, quoted by Bryan Liles in his talk [Test all the f\*\*\*ing time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwUR0kOVNs8)

> Great teams make great engineers.

> I’ve never seen a team of absolutely miserable engineers creating a product that delights their users. And I’ve never seen a company with absolutely miserable users, where their engineers enjoyed their work."

—Charity Majors, 11:08 and 2:55 in [It is Time to Fulfill the Promise of Continuous Delivery (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t1mwQYawOI)

—Charity Majors

> I think of continuous delivery as a kind of second-generation extreme programming approach, firmly grounded in the techniques of test-driven development.

—Dave Farley, [The Difference Between Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment, 3:19](https://youtu.be/7SNbDWob6cI?t=199)

> Every model is ultimately the expression of one thing we think we hope to understand in terms of another that we think we do understand.”

> Science is the study of those things that can be reduced to the study of other things.”

> Every significant thinker in science has drawn upon useful analogies for simplifying certain stages of thought.”

> We want to understand and communicate the ways in which thinkers in all fields use analogies and, when necessary, convert them into models.”

—G.M. Weinberg, _An Introduction to General Systems Thinking_, p. 28-31

> It isn't what we don't know that gives us trouble, it's what we know that ain't so.

quoted (unattributed) by G. M. Weinberg, _An Introduction To General Systems Thinking_, p. 43

> Metaphor is like function. Instead of ‘My love is like a red, red rose…’ we could write ‘loved one = f(rose, …)’ which states that loved one is like a rose, in some unspecified way f.”

—G.M. Weinberg, _An Introduction To General Systems Thinking_, p. 142

> Science may be thought of as the process of learning which ways of looking at things yield invariant laws.

—G.M. Weinberg, _An Introduction To General Systems Thinking_, p. 203

> The medicine person's primary allegiance is not to the human community, but to the earthly web of relations in which the community is embedded—it is from this that his or her power to alleviate human illness derives.

> Countless anthropologists have managed to overlook the ecological dimension of the shaman's craft, while writing at great length of the shaman's rapport with "supernatural" entities. We can attribute much of this oversight to the modern, civilized assumption that the natural world is largely determinate and mechanical, and that that which is regarded as mysterious, powerful, and beyond human ken must therefore be of some other, nonphysical realm _above_ nature, "supernatural."

> Magic in its perhaps most primordial sense, is the experience of existing in a world made up of multiple intelligences, the intuition that every form one perceives—from the swallow swooping overhead to the fly on a blade of grass, and indeed the blade of grass itself—is an _experiencing_ form, an entity with its own predilections and sensations, albeit sensations that are very different from our own.

> It is likely that the "inner world" of our Western psychological experience, like the supernatural heaven of Christian belief, originates in the loss of our ancestral reciprocity with the animate earth.

> It is not by sending his awareness out beyond the natural world that the shaman makes contact with the purveyors of life and health, nor by journeying into his personal psyche; rather, it is by propelling his awareness laterally, outward into the depths of a landscape at once both sensuous and psychological, the living dream that we share with the soaring hawk, the spider, and the stone silently sprouting lichens on its coarse surface.

—David Abram, _The Spell of the Sensuous_, p. 8-10

> Has object-oriented programming peaked? Is it something that is no longer going to be the future? I think the answer to that is 'yes'.

—Richard Feldman, [The Next Paradigm Shift in Programming (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/6YbK8o9rZfI?t=2451)

> Harmony — balance — does not mean fixity of inactive factors, but equilibrium of the most intense energies.

—Arnold Schoenberg, Theory of Harmony (1911, 1922, tr. 1978), p. 31

> Free from what? What is that to Zarathustra! But your eyes should announce to me brightly: free for what?

—Friedrich Nietzsche, _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_ (originally published in German, in 1883)

> Once complexity has accumulated, it is hard to eliminate, since fixing a single dependency or obscurity will not, by itself, make a big difference. In order to slow the growth of complexity, you must adopt a "zero tolerance" philosophy.

—John Ousterhout, _A Philosophy of Software Design_ (2018), p. 11

> The first step toward becoming a good software designer is to realize that working code isn’t enough. It’s not acceptable to introduce unnecessary complexities in order to finish your current task faster. The most important thing is the long-term structure of the system.

—John Ousterhout, _A Philosophy of Software Design_, p. 14

> One of the most important elements of software design is determining who needs to know what, and when.

—John Ousterhout, _A Philosophy of Software Design_, p. 43

> "One dress and one bowl, under a tree and on a stone" graphically describes the monk's life in India. Compared with this, the modern Zen monk must be said to be abundantly supplied. Still his wants are reduced to a minimum and none can fail to lead a simple, perhaps the simplest, life if he models his after the life of a Zen monk. The desire to possess is considered by Buddhism to be one of the worst passions with which mortals, are apt to be obsessed. What, in fact, causes so much misery in the world is the universal impulse of acquisition. As power is desired, the strong always tyrannize over the weak; as wealth is coveted, the rich and poor are always crossing swords of bitter enmity. International wars rage, social unrest ever increases, unless this impulse to get and to hold is completely uprooted. Cannot society be reorganized upon an entirely different basis from what we have been used to see from the beginning of history? Cannot we ever hope to stop the massing of wealth and the accumulation of power merely from the desire for individual or national aggrandizement? Despairing of the utter irrationality of human affairs, Buddhist monks have gone to the other extreme and cut themselves off even from reasonable and perfectly innocent enjoyments of life. However, the Zen ideal of putting a monk's belongings into a tiny box is his mute protest, though so far ineffective, against the present order of society.

—D. T. Suzuki, _An Introduction to Zen Buddhism_ (1914), p. 120 (1991 Grove Press)

> When a lioness gives birth to her cubs it is proverbially believed that after three days she pushes them over a precipice to see if they can climb back to her. Those that fail to meet this test are no longer cared about. Whether this is true or not, something like it is aimed at by the Zen master, who will often treat his monks with every manner of seeming unkindness.

—D. T. Suzuki, _An Introduction to Zen Buddhism_, p. 123

> The idea behind test-driven development has always been "what should the API of our code look like? If I am an external consumer of this code and I come to call it, what kind of API would I find useful?" You're testing as much the usability of the API — how you interact with it — as you are designing that public-facing API. You tell yourself a story about how this API should look if you were a consumer. The test becomes the first consumer of your code that says "what should this look like and how should it work?" That is the objective of test-driven development.

—Ian Cooper, [TDD, Where Did It All Go Wrong (34:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM&t=2055)

> I think of it as observability-driven development. It's like TDD, but TDD stops at the border of your laptop. TDD assumes that the system works so you can check if your code works. That is a mighty big assumption. Observability-driven development encompasses production in that. ODD practices instrumentation as you're writing your code with an eye to your future self who is going to need to understand it. ODD means that you have muscle-memory that remembers that when you merge code you go and you watch it deploy and you look at it through the lens of the instrumentation that you just wrote and you ask yourself "is it doing what I wanted it to do and does anything else look weird?"

—Charity Majors, [The Socio-technical Path to High-Performing Teams (37:03)](https://youtu.be/KtrJaqD67Oc?t=2223)

> Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention; let your soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your mind as a dominant, wholly absorbing idea. Make an orderly series of your different studies, so as to throw yourself into them completely. Let each task take entire hold of you, as if it were the only one. That was Napoleon's secret; it is the secret of all who are great in action. Men of genius themselves were great only by bringing all their powers to bear on the point on which they had decided to concentrate.

—Antonin Sertillanges, _The Intellectual Life_ [translated by Mary Ryan (The Spirit of Work, II. Concentration, p. 127)](https://portalconservador.com/livros/A.D.Sertillanges—-The-Intellectual-Life.pdf)

> Salvation, if it is attainable at all, even partially, is to be sought in a deeper understanding of the ways of systems, not simply in a criticism of the errors of a particular system.

—John Gall, _Systemantics_, [p. xii](http://www.bussigel.com/systemsforplay/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Systemantics.pdf)

> Sages for the people; the American in his cabin, the Spaniard in his provincial café. [Machado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Machado) too expressed a horror of the solemn and had the same smiling gravity.

—Octavio Paz, "Robert Frost" (Vermont, June 1945), _On Poets and Others_, p. 7 (1986; tr. Michael Schmidt)
