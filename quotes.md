To ignore them is not yet to be fully human.

—James Coplien, forward to _Clean Code_ by Robert Martin (pp. xxi and xxii)

> Especially whatever is floating, inconspicuous, or fleeting reveals itself only to deep, contemplative attention. Likewise, it is only contemplative lingering that has access to phenomena that are long and slow. Paul Cézanne, a master of deep, contemplative attention, once remarked that he could _see_ the fragrance of things. This visualization of fragrances requires profound attention. In the contemplative state, one steps outside oneself, so to speak, and immerses oneself in the surroundings. Merleau-Ponty describes Cézanne's mode of contemplatively observing a landscape as a kind of externalization or de-interiorization: "He would start by discovering the geological structure of the landscape; then, according to Mme Cézanne, he would halt and gaze, eyes dilated. . . . "The landscape thinks itself in me," he said, "and I am its consciousness."

—Byung-Chul Han, _The Burnout Society_ ("Profound Boredom", p. 14)

> Teams often consider requirements as something carved in stone that has to match exactly what customers demand. In fact, customers will often accept a different solution if it solves the problem, especially if it is a lot cheaper and easier to implement.

—Gojko Adzic, _Bridging the Communication Gap_, pp. 30-31

> Often the original proponent of a theory or technique understands its promise, its liabilities, and its proper domain more clearly than his later disciples. Less gifted, more fervent, their very fervor leads to rigidity, misapplication, oversimplification.

—Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., _The Design of Design_, p. 31

> Do not try to imitate the old masters. Seek what they sought.
