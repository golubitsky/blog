Hello! My name is Mike Golubitsky. Welcome to my blog about learning machine learning and data science. Check out my [résumé]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Mikhail Golubitsky Resume.pdf "Resume").

I was born in St. Petersburg and I grew up in Boston. I played [piano](https://soundcloud.com/mikegolubitsky/20170624_morning), trombone, and [composed music](https://soundcloud.com/mikegolubitsky/evolution).
Then I became a recording engineer. I [recorded](https://soundcloud.com/mikegolubitsky/mahler-94-excerpt) the music of Mahler (who later became, and remains to this day, my favorite composer) performed by an orchestra with a leading American conductor at the helm, and a cool [fusion jazz band](https://soundcloud.com/mikegolubitsky/live-jazz-band-recording-2014) in LA.

In 2014, I felt like... there was _something out there_... so I left LA. I left my recording career behind, moved to San Francisco, attended [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/), and became a software engineer. As a software engineer I've enjoyed being humbled by my colleagues, [striving](http://programmingstudies.tumblr.com/post/151737928042/guard-the-business-logic) to write beautiful code, writing tests first, and generally [thinking](http://programmingstudies.tumblr.com/post/165599638862/thought) [differently](http://programmingstudies.tumblr.com/post/155399053522/programming) than before. Here's a fun [Maze Generator &amp; Solver](https://golubitsky.github.io/maze_solver/) I made a while back.

After working for a few years as a software engineer in SF I wrapped up my affairs there and left to travel in Nepal and in India, along the way trekking in the Everest region (I first hiked in "serious" mountains while I was a recording engineer intern at the Aspen Music Festival in Colorado), volunteering at a school on the outskirts of Kathmandu, Nepal to teach computer science to children -- some of whom don't even have a computer at home, and later visiting [the place where Buddha became enlightened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodh_Gaya), where I attended the in-person teachings of H.H. The Dalai Lama and shook hands with a monk who, having walked some 2000 kilometers, had arrived there on foot from Thailand. My Western notions of "Asian mysticism" regularly clashed with the hyper-commercialism and Westernization I observed throughout my travels. I also found the [most interesting book I've read in years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_Different).

Even during my time in India I [was already](http://programmingstudies.tumblr.com/post/169741458807/hoztel-jaipur-india) studying machine learning -- at a hostel with high-speed internet access, where I ended up staying long enough to observe a surreal [kite festival](https://goo.gl/vppdJX): throughout the day kites are flown and at dusk fireworks and lanterns light up the sky, sent up _from rooftops all across the city_, families eating street food together, the air giddy and effervescent.

During 4 months of traveling I realized that I didn't feel much like _physically_ traveling anymore, so much as like continuing to learn about ML. I believe we're on the cusp of some massive changes that will be brought about by the continuously-increasing processing power and better and more-accurate models of the world, and I want to be on the engineering side of that evolution.
