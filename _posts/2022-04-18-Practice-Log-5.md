Today was the [bebop melodic minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebop_scale#Bebop_melodic_minor_scale) — as always, recalling Barry Harris — RIP.

- in contrary motion — that is, the left hand ascends while the right hand descends (and vice-versa)
- in all 12 keys.

Some keys were definitely harder than others. D was a hard key. There were others, which I should note next time around.

From the Wiki (link above) I note:

- this scale has all the notes from both the harmonic and melodic minor scales. (Kinda nifty?)
- the fully diminished chord on the II of the scale has a _strong_ dominant function.

### Symmetry

Meditating more on that diminished chord on the II of the scale, I note:

- for the [bebop major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebop_scale#Bebop_major_scale)
  - I can walk the entire scale alternating between the `I Major 6` and `ii full diminished`
- for the bebop melodic minor scale
  - I can walk the entire scale alternating between the `I minor 6` and `ii full diminished`

In both cases I can think of this, equivalently, as either:

- move each note up the scale, or
- simply taking the next inversion of the alternate chord.

This begins to have _huge_ power once I start doing, like, "drop 2 voicings" (and of course this is the tip of the iceberg that Barry Harris showed in some of the videos I've seen on YouTube).

I think that this symmetry is a big deal in his system.

Man, so many ways to look at this stuff.
