Was just jamming out to (from my mind) Jill Scott's _It's Love_.

Just the left hand playing the chords, straight, on beats 1, 3, and 4.

Right hand trying to do stuff without messing up the left hand.

And then somehow my voice joined in.

And then my right hand was trying to follow exactly my voice. A strange and new sensation of "being torn apart" or of space-time becoming somehow torn. A new sort of coordination needed.

Simplify, concentrate, groove.

What can be more [agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) than this?
