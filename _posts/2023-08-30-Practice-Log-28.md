I've been into Ahmad Jamal's _Poinciana_. Simple, collected, rhythmic.

Exercises should be simple & memorable.

Take a `minor iv`and `major I` .

4/4 time. Quarter note triplets. Arpeggiate up and down. 1 measure to a chord (12 notes to a chord).

Start with 1 voice. Slow. On any one note of the `minor iv` chord. 6 notes up, 6 notes down.

Choose the most musical first note of the `major I`. It should flow from the last note in the `minor iv`. 6 notes up, 6 notes down.

Move keys up a fourth. But again, and always, start on the `minor iv`. For example, from the key of C, move to the key of Bb; that is from the `major I C chord` (in C) move to the `minor iv Bb chord` (in F).

As a result, the same range of the piano will be used while going through different inversions of major and minor chords, as well as practicing the cadence.

How does this fit into _Poinciana_? The same chord progression occurs from at the end of the tune's A section (on the `minor iv`) going into another A section (which starts on the `major I`).

Eventually, 2 voices, one per hand. In 6ths and 5ths.

Still later, 3 voices (drop "2" voicing).)
