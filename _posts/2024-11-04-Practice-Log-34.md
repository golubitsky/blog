title: "Practice Log: The Stevie Wonder Chord"

A fruitful few days. A couple of weeks ago I listened to a few Stevie Wonder songs. His music is such a gift to the world—particularly from his peak creative period in the 70s. Songs like _If It's Magic_ and _As_ are so lyrically moving; songs like _I Am Happier Than The Morning Sun_ are the definition of innocence. _You and I_ really struck me. At this point in my musical journey I felt ready to dive into it. What makes the song challenging is that to get the right sound, most chords are not in root position.

_You and I_ revolves around what I playfully dubbed as "the Stevie Wonder chord" — the "minor 2 flat 5" (or "minor two half-diminished".. or.. the "minor four add six" because every 7-chord can be thought of as an add-6-chord, and then of course there is the classical "6 chord", which is the first inversion of a triad, but I digress..). It, or a version of it, appears in a number of his songs, but obviously it existed before Stevie Wonder.

For example, it is featured prominently in two Cole Porter songs. It is the first chord in _All Of You_, resolving to the major one. And in \_Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\_ the sound appears over the key line of "from major to minor" (a [word painting](https://www.thesongwritingdesk.com/word-painting.html)). In this case, it is actually over a dominant VII chord, the upper structure of which, with the added 9, forms the very same chord. In that progression, we go from the IVmaj7 ("from major") to the VII9 ("to minor").

And so, I arrive at an exercise:

- I ii7flat5 IV ii7flat5 (repeat), respecting voice leading up and down the keyboard.
