title: Musical patterns found in a turnaround

On the 27th page of [Phil DeGreg's Jazz Keyboard Harmony](https://phildegreg.com/book/) I find the common chord progression (or turnaround) `I△ ♭iiiᵒ ii⁷ ♭II△`.

After a few weeks of practicing in all 12 keys, today I note the following patterns:

- I use the same chord progression, above.
- The `chord tones` are at least _somewhat_ diatonic to the chord and associated scales. This could be more systematic, but basically I added those that I could "bear" in abstraction.
- The `scale tones` refer to the scale of the `I` chord.
- `intervals` are always either whole-tones (W) or half-tones (H).
- parentheses denote optional notes
- NOTE: It is not clear how best to refer to the chord tones in a diminished 7 chord.

### Descending Patterns

- Rows composed of whole-tones
  - 1, 2, and 3 form a scale.
  - 1 and 2 form a complete whole-tone scale; there is a half-step between rows 2 and 3.
- Rows 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 form a scale. This one could be useful. Covers a wide range of colors. Suggests mixolydian bebop scale at first.
- Rows composed of half-tones
  - 8: diatonic
  - 9: airy, palatable dissonance
  - 10: dissonant, esp. on `♭iiiᵒ`; parallel fifths with bass
- Row 11 originally confused me with Soulive (see below).

| #   | intervals | chord tones   | scale tones    |
| --- | --------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| 1   | W W W     | `5 9 ♭9 1`    | `5 4 ♭3 ♭2`    |
| 2   | W W W     | `7 ♭5 11 3`   | `7 6 5 4`      |
| 3   | W W W     | `3 M7 7 13`   | `3 2 1 ♭7`     |
| 4   | H W H     | `1 ♭6 5 5`    | `1 7 6 ♭6`     |
| 5   | W H H     | `5 9 9 9`     | `5 4 3 ♭3`     |
| 6   | W H H     | `9 ♭♭7 13 13` | `2 1 7 ♭7`     |
| 7   | H H W     | `13 11 11 3`  | `6 ♭6 5 4`     |
| 8   | H H H     | `3 1 1 1`     | `3 ♭3 2 ♭2`    |
| 9   | H H H     | `♯11 9 9 9`   | `♯11 4 3 ♭3`   |
| 10  | H H H     | `7 P5 5 5`    | `7 ♭7 6 ♭6`    |
| 11  | H H (W)   | `5 ♭3 ♭3 (9)` | `5 ♯11 4 (♭3)` |

### Ascending Patterns

TODO!

## Another progression, from _Soulive - Turn It Out_

I spent a bunch of time confusing myself by thinking that one of the above patterns could be found at the beginning of [Soulive's Turn It Out](https://youtu.be/2XP4foJZbw4). It turns out that this classic composition begins with a loosely related progression: `I△ ♭iiᵒ ii⁷ Vsus♭9`, also leveraging passing diminished chords. The melody — using this other progression — goes like this:

| intervals | chord tones | scale tones |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| ↓m2 ↓m2 ↑m3 | `7 ᵒ7 5 11` | `7 ♭7 6 1`  |

I'm actually very proud of myself for getting this; there was a time when I could not figure this out!

Not only that, but it turns out I can even easily pick out the melody now.

Man, what an epic track, epic solos. These guys built a subculture and inspired a generation. Definitely the band I've seen the most number of times in my life (unless I count UMass Lowell's lowercase p).

I think this might be the next one to practice.
