[Robert Glasper Trio - Blues Skies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYXWbcKW_bw).

As I listened to Glasper's solo I had the image of patterns repeating across the entire keyboard.

Among the many aspects of playing at this level is the ability to see the patterns repeating across the whole keyboard. The "C major chord" is not just _these_ 3 notes, C, E, and G. It is _every_ C, E, and G â€” across the keyboard.

Arpeggios, scales, etc.

Also impeccable rhythm.
