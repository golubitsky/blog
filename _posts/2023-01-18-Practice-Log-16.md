Around the circle of fifths, slowly.

Pick any 1 major chord and 1 of the 5 other majors with no shared chord tones (i.e., in C: B,Bb,Db,D,F# see [previous post]({{ "/2023/01/05/Practice-Log-15" | relative_url }})).

Consider "drop 2 voicings for triads", e.g. ascending, root=C,G,E, 1st=E,C,G, 2nd=G,E,C consist of intervals: P5,M6; m6,P5; M6,m6 respectively.

LH: arpeggiate, stepping up through the inversions, Bb -> B -> Bb 1st inv -> B 1st inv -> etc.

On the way down, start with the top note rather than the bottom â€” completely different feel.

### 7th chords?

Looking ahead, clearly the missing piece. Will probably yield smoother motion.
