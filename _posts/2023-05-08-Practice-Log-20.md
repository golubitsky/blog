Current rotation:

- Horace Silver - Nica's Dream
  - A distraction from flipping to A Night in Tunisia (would like to learn that melody cold) in the Real Book; but stayed with it.
- [Chick Corea - Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp5B64jXbu0)
  - This was from last fall. Would like to revisit.
- [Hirumi - The Seeker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHDNaw1NLTM)
  - Good practice for rhythm; some nice sus chords after the intro.
  - Feels really good; not intellectual; the form is on my level (though certainly not her Oscar Peterson-esque soloing).
  - Intro: `C Gm Am A♭` `Am D7 F C`
- [Snarky Puppy - Thing of Gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZBlRkF0-to)
  - Playing through just the chords first chords in chorus fills with warmth.
  - Chorus (beginning): `B♭△ Gm9 G♭△ D♭△ A♭△ E♭△`
  - It would be challenging to cover this because it's really an orchestra; lots of polyrhythmic vamping over one chord.
