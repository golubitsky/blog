Current rotation:

- [Horace Silver - Nica's Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDrxzKYdwsA)
  - From flipping to _A Night in Tunisia_ (would like to learn that melody cold) in the Real Book; but stayed with it.
  - Invites a study of the "class minor" — the minor with a major 6 with an optional major 7. A `V i` cadence over one chord essentially. - - Another way to voice is with root + 3rd and 7th, but in this case root + 3rd and 6th (where the minor 3rd and major 6th make the tritone).
  - I have always played minor 7 chords, which miss all of the above and have a completely different sound (somehow not as rich).
  - It's hard to play the trumpet and sax rhythms together; a very rhythmic piece overall.
  - Should study the piano comping over the sax (first) and trumpet (second) solos separately for additional ideas.
    - syncopated over the A section
    - straight over the B section
  - Piano solo is very simple, but cohesive. Also worth studying.
  - I'm embarrassed to say I hadn't realized Horace Silver was a pianist!
  - [original 1959 recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lju13U1zEE) is slower
- [Chick Corea - Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp5B64jXbu0)
  - This was from last fall. Would like to revisit.
- [Hirumi - The Seeker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHDNaw1NLTM)
  - Good practice for rhythm; some nice sus chords after the intro.
  - Feels really good; not intellectual; the form is on my level (though certainly not her Oscar Peterson-esque soloing).
  - Intro: `C Gm Am A♭` `Am D7 F C`
- [Snarky Puppy - Thing of Gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZBlRkF0-to)
  - Playing through just the chords first chords in chorus fills with warmth.
  - Chorus (beginning): `B♭△ Gm9 G♭△ D♭△ A♭△ E♭△`
  - It would be challenging to cover this because it's really an orchestra; lots of polyrhythmic vamping over one chord.
- [Bobby Hebb - Sunny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubvYQxTXO3U)
  - Classic in minor. It's about time I learned it.
  - Surprising amount of rhythmic complexity in just the repeating bass line and melody.
- [Sister Sledge - We Are Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMVe_HcyP9Y&t=1s)
  - Classic major, open, sus sound.
  - Again, interesting to see how to cover this, since so much of the sound comes from polyrhythmic vamping.
