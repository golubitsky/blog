One other person I've recently been inspired by is Barry Harris. An interesting aspect of this is that Barry Harris has on more than one occasion spoken [against Bill Evans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-4L9lgty5c&t) and [modal jazz in general](https://youtu.be/BjnX_PkDwWs?t=612).

However in my view, they agree in fundamental ways. Specifically I believe

- Harris shares the view on "jazz as process" and "jazz as part of broader tradition of improvised music" expressed by Bill Evans in the [previous post]({{ "/2020/12/04/Bill-Evans" | relative_url }}).
- Harris [mentions](https://youtu.be/BjnX_PkDwWs?t=276) [Horowitz performing a Chopin Mazurka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfNSE_cwVcA) ("Boy.. that mazurka could be a jazz standard!.."), and indeed one can hear clear parallels between it and Evans' music.
- Harris on [Bach and Chopin and how 'they' stopped teaching improvisation](https://youtu.be/BjnX_PkDwWs?t=824).
  - Also (same link) mentions the need to know the "basics" -- full agreement with Bill Evans' notion of "better to play within simple framework, but have control, than to play something complicated and lack control" ([source](https://youtu.be/5MSCReTIeH8?t=57))

Heck, to bring it back to the broader tradition, even Miles Davis (a leading proponent of modal jazz) ["got it from Rachmaninoff"](https://youtu.be/VXhmvOa5Xjo?t=220).
