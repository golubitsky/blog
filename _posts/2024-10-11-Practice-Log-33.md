Exercises like these are what I imagine people like Bud Powell and John Coltrane and Chopin and Bach worked on. Their recorded output is the tip of their "exercise iceberg".

1. Circle of fourths. 1 chord per bar (or so). Dominant sevenths. 3rd and 7th in the left hand. Right hand 8th notes in the Mixolydian mode; vary patterns: broken thirds, ascending/descending tetrachords, etc.
2. "Classic jazz sound" revolves around Major 6th chords (and dominants). Particularly walking the scale on the 1 major 6 and 5 major 6. _When Sunny Gets Blue_.
3. Circle of fourths. Alternate minor (particularly in first inversion) and dominant. Broken chords. To cover both chord qualities across the cycle, there are two sets (i.e., c minor and C dominant).
4. Circle of fourths. Arpeggios in both hands, but one chord tone away.
5. Modulate up a major 3rd using a 2-5-1. For example, loop the A section of Misty like this, modulating at the end of each 8 bars.
