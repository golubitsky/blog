A Night in Tunisia. Amazingly fruitful. Continued study of the "min-maj" minor, this time with the `♭IIdom7sharp11` leading to the `imaj7` (E♭7 to D- in the tune). But crucially the bass line from the intro. Just jam over that and try to hit the melody in a "fake it till you make it" way. Just make it sound good. Don't hit all the melody notes. Just go between the two chords. Voicings jump out. Holy cow.

Check out the `F B C# E` voicing over the D minor, coming from a standard "A" voicing from the Eb. Crunchy as ^%$#.
