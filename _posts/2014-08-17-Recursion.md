> You can apply recursion to any problem that can be decomposed into simpler problems of the same form.

Recursion is fascinating. Probably more so than anything. Why? Everything in the universe is recursive. That's why there is no "because" to the ultimate "why?". So far. All processes, ideas, beliefs, phenomena are recursive.

Except in the universe, at the most abstract, most general, all-encompassing scope (whatever that might describe) there is no "escape condition."

Or else the escape condition is beyond our conscious capacity. So far.

Or else the creation of such an abstract concept as "a recursive universe with no escape condition"--if indeed the concept does not truly exist (perhaps there really is an "end" to the universe, as well as a "beginning")-- is a function of our consciousness, in which case it is our consciousness itself which is recursive.

And but our consciousness is part of the universe. It exists in the universe. Thus infinities exist whether they "actually" exist or "not!"
