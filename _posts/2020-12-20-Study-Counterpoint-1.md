title: The Study of Counterpoint
---

From Johann Jesph Fux's Gradus Ad Parnassum, translated and edited by Alfred Mann.

## Introduction

- Study of counterpoint could be compared to the study of perspective; both important developments in Renaissance art; rise of three-dimensional thought.
- Discantus (two voices) was predecessor to counterpoint.
- Published in 1725.
- Based on Palestrina; not Bach.
- Studied by Haydn, Mozart.
- Beethoven had hoped to study with Mozart. Mozart died. Haydn was second choice. Beethoven "demanded a more systematic instruction than Haydn was, by age and temperament, disposed to give."
- Beethoven's studies were published; list of subscribers to French edition included "Cherubini, Berlioz, Meyerbeer, Chopin, Rossini, Auber, Paganini, Moscheles, Hummel, Liszt"
- Chain proceeds to Schubert, Bruckner, Brahms; and finally to Strauss and Hindemith.

## Counterpoint

> In earlier times, instead of our modern notes, dots or points were used. Thus one used to call a composition in which point was set against or counter to point, counterpoint.

> A composition which is written strictly according to technical rules.

## Consonance

|        | Type of interval                                         | Type of consonance |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Unison | Consonance                                               | Perfect            |
| 2nd    | Dissonance                                               |                    |
| 3rd    | Consonance                                               | Imperfect          |
| 4th    | Dissonance; consonance if the higher note is fundamental |                    |
| 5th    | Consonance                                               | Perfect            |
| 6th    | Consonance                                               | Imperfect          |
| 7th    | Dissonance                                               |                    |
| 8ve    | Consonance                                               | Perfect            |

- Purpose of harmony: pleasure.
- Pleasure is awakened by variety of sounds.
- Variety: result of progression from one interval to another.
- Progression is achieved by motion.

> Thus it remains to examine the nature of motion.

## Motion

### Direct

Two or more parts ascend or descend in the same direction by step or skip (don't have to be the same in all cases).

### Contrary

One part ascends and the other descends.

### Oblique

One part moves while the other remains stationary.

## 4 Fundamental Rules

(`P`erfect; `I`mperfect; `C`onsonance.)

Motions that are allowed:

1. `PC -> PC` -- contrary or oblique motion.
2. `PC -> IC` -- any motion.
3. `IC -> PC` -- contrary or oblique.
4. `IC -> IC` -- any motion.

TL;DR -- Direct motion into a perfect consonance is NOT allowed.

## First Species of Counterpoint

- Simplest composition of two or more voices.

  - Notes of equal length.
  - Only consonances.

- Can be composed on all modes whose tonic note is part of `P5` (i.e. not Locrian) -- cannot be the final of a mode.

- Adding an accidental to create a 5th: **natural mode** -> **transposed mode**.
  - Not considering transposed modes for now.

### Cantus Firmus (`cf`)

Melody.

- Possibility of vocal performance.
- No augmented, diminished, chromatic intervals.
- No intervals larger than 5th, except 8ve and minor sixth (latter only in upward direction).
- Avoid too high/too low registers; skips following each other in same direction; skips not subsequently compensated.
- Avoid tritone progression in one voice: devil in music.

### Counterpoint (`cp`)

- Each note in `cf` receives suitable consonance in voice above or below.
- Contrary or oblique motion used as much as possible.
- Greater care needed when using direct motion.
- More imperfect than perfect consonances should be used.
  - Imperfect -> more harmonious (reason not yet given).
- Begin (perfection) and end (relaxation) with perfect consonances.
  - Imperfect lack perfection; cannot express relaxation.
- Voice crossing: allowed, if it improves voice leading.
- Unison: only allowed at beginning and end.
- Octave: avoid from larger intervals (Italian: "battuta", Greek: "thesis").
- Accidentals allowed in [special cases](https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/10733/accidentals-in-first-species-counterpoint), more or less to accommodate leading tones.

#### When counterpoint above

- Next to last bar: `M6`

#### When counterpoint below

- 5th should not be used to begin if it takes the melody out of the mode. 8ve instead.
- Next to last bar: `m3`
