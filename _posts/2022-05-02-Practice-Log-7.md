- minor chords in second inversion can be built on _many_ (but not all) degrees of the blues scale
  - the ones that sound good minor chords build on: 5, 6, 1, 2, ♭3
  - but _must_ use second inversion (3rd on top)
  - really standard, savage blues sound
- turns out the ones that sound good sort of follow the "A" position voicing built on 7th, 3rd, and b5 of the scale

Listening to [Herbie Hancock — St. Louis Blues](https://youtu.be/HzpYpg1eoCs) — Stevie Wonder has such a distinct sound on the harmonica that I immediately knew it was him. And sure enough, do-do-do-dooo.
