Today I was listening to Ray Charles.

When I got to [Georgia On My Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YZzZIt6Tmg&t=990s) I was filled with an actionable desire to play this song at the piano.

And I used the [Fake Book Index](https://www.seventhstring.com/fbindex.html) to realize that it is in the Real Book Volume 2, which I luckily own.

I flipped to the page with _Georgia_ and was completely distracted by the glorious [Get Me To The Church On Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvyIeXGafaw). As a kid, I was lucky to have been introduced by my Mom to this phenomenal musical overflowing with magnificent songs.

And life was good.

### Sus chords

Recently, have been toying with major scale constructions of (ascending) `3 5 1 2` and (inverted) `2 3 5 1`. Really beautiful simple open sound.

Also there is the related `1 2 5 7` (doesn't really work in any inversions...).

### André Previn

I hadn't realized he had died. I associate him more than anything else with a video on YouTube in which he interviews Oscar Peterson and relates a story about the classical musician who had come to see Art Tatum to excitedly share "hi Art, I've been practicing for months and I finally learned your piece and not only that but I composed some variations on it!" And Art listened, and nodded, and thought for a bit, and then proceeded to play some insane improvisations — "your ideas made me think of these new variations." I just looked it up: the piece had been [Tea for Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kMEPYU1Xwg) ([too many notes, your majesty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCud8H7z7vU)!), the pianist [Horowitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5mxU_7BTRA) ("This is not a concert, it’s a miracle", wrote one commenter on YouTube). Hear [Previn tell the story](https://youtu.be/BFNsywQOW1I?t=860)!

I also hadn't realized that Previn had been the music supervisor for _My Fair Lady_, and that he had been involved in jazz — I had always thought of him as a classical master.
