Today I was listening to Ray Charles.

When I got to [Georgia On My Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YZzZIt6Tmg&t=990s) I was filled with an actionable desire to play this song at the piano.

And I used the [Fake Book Index](https://www.seventhstring.com/fbindex.html) to realize that it is in the Real Book Volume 2, which I luckily own.

I flipped to the page with _Georgia_ and was completely distracted by the glorious [Get Me To The Church On Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvyIeXGafaw). As a kid, I was lucky to have been introduced by my Mom to this phenomenal musical overflowing with magnificent songs.

And life was good.

### Sus chords

Recently, have been toying with major scale constructions of (ascending) `3 5 1 2` and (inverted) `2 3 5 1`. Really beautiful simple open sound.

Also there is the related `1 2 5 7`.
