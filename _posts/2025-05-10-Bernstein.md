I feel a sea change happening.

The biggest musical phases of my life, in rough chronological order, began when I was seven—a Russian-Jewish immigrant growing up in the suburbs of Boston, MA:

- Green Day
- Nirvana
- Metallica
- Nobuo Uematsu (via Final Fantasy 6)
- Paul Oakenfold
- Pink Floyd
- Miles Davis (senior year of high school-ish)
- Stevie Wonder (college)
- Michael Jackson
- Tower of Power and Earth, Wind & Fire
- Elliott Smith (some time after college)
- Gustav Mahler
- Bill Evans

The Mahler phase was perhaps the most intense and long-lasting. After that, for years, I didn’t feel a gravitational pull toward any particular artist. But when I started practicing piano again after moving back to Boston, I rediscovered Bill Evans. For years, he has been an influence in the background. I don't always listen to his music, but I keep coming back again and again to his arrangements.

I have written [written before]({{ "/2021/03/18/Worlds-Colliding" | relative_url }}) of Leonard Bernstein's influence on Bill Evans: Evans made _Some Other Time_ one of his standards and was so deeply influenced by it that one of his own most famous compositions—_Peace Piece_—is based on it. I’ve also written about Bernstein’s connection to Mahler. In the documentary _Leonard Bernstein: Reaching for the Note_, a fellow composer suggests Bernstein may have felt himself to be—paraphrasing here—the second coming of Mahler. Bernstein, in his _The Unanswered Question: Six Talks at Harvard_ lectures, describes Mahler as a prophet—someone who, even before his death in 1911, had foreseen the century’s destructiveness.

Most recently I have come to know yet more of Bernstein's music: I watched the intensely tragic _West Side Story_ and have been listening to the original Broadway recordings of it. [_Tonight_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8My-HMJWeo), in particular, takes my breath away. And I can learn from it. I _am_ learning from it: studying how Bernstein modulates between tonalities, practicing his left-hand accompaniment rhythms, absorbing his harmonic language. It’s not exactly simpler than Bill Evans’, but somehow, it feels more approachable.

And so, as I continue to learn from him, it occurs to me that the great Leonard Bernstein—as I called him last week at the Drawing Board Brewing Company after performing his _Somewhere_ (also from _West Side Story_)—also belongs on that list.
