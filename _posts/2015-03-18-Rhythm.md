As I was running down the stairs of a mall in downtown SF to get a salad, running to the beat of--what was it--Toundra? Explosions in the Sky? Wild Nothing? If These Trees Could Talk? I've been listening to a lot of music new to me recently--as I was running and the rhythm of my footsteps and the derivative of the length in between each and the arc of the overall movement described by all the footsteps together in-tandem--it all felt as if I were participating in a rhythm, and there was a moment of discovery.

oh that moment

And but so the universe is always participating in a rhythm. All physics is rhythm. All action and reaction and flow and transformation.

And at times we are more participating in all that than not.

Then is there something a-rhythmic? Haha.

Hmm.
