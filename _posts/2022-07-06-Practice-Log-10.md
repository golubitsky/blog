- left hand + right hand together, one voice each:

  - octaves - basic, not trivial
  - skip a note between voices, so alternate P5, m6, M6
  - skip three notes between voices, so alternate M10, m10, P11

- 8 note voicings (the Rachmaninoff voicings in the [B section of Prelude in G minor](https://youtu.be/M8RyWFA7PSY?t=32))

  - simply all three 3 inversions of 8 notes in a row (4 in each hand)

- suspensions/enclosures
  - structure
    - one hand plays two chord tones, skipping a voice between them
    - other hand plays the other voice directly above (or below), but starts on the half step above and "encloses" that chord tone
    - e.g., one hand: C + G, other hand: F-E-Eb-E
  - possibilities (at least the most basic ones)
    - 3 possible enclosures starting half step above
      - ♭9-1 - reminds of "indignation" and some very classical composers, specifically, I think of Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, even Bach
        - first sounding is composed of 2 stacked minor 6ths (i.e., `5 3 ♭9` ascending)
      - 4-3 - restful, but slightly dissonant starting on that 4
      - ♭6-5 - shares the very classical sound with the `♭9-1`
        - first sounding is composed of 2 stacked major 6ths (i.e., `3 1 ♭6` ascending)
    - 3 possible enclosures starting whole step above
      - 9-1 - perhaps the most at rest of all 6
      - ♯11-3 - very unsettled obviously
      - 6-5 - playful, basic
  - observations
    - when upper voice plays the enclosure, both of the ones that start with stacked 6th have the most balanced sound, powerful in the 2 octaves below middle C, in particular.
    - intervals change when lower voice plays the enclosure; leads to very different sound
