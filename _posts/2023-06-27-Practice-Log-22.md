I've been playing Don't Get Around Much Anymore. It's the jazz tune I learned first on the trombone, back in the day, in elementary school. I learned it again in college with Professor Anthony Mele's help. But I haven't played it much over the last few years. It was easy to pick up. Much easier than other tunes.

I started transposing it to F — it might be my favorite key now.. —

Passing diminished chords

Barry Harris's C major+flat6 scale, starting on the a minor — passing from a minor (he would call it the C major 6) up to the dimished back to the a minor. Drop 2 voicing.
