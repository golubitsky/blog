Motion is the most crucial aspect of music.

I felt this just now while practicing _Someday My Prince Will Come_, one of the tunes I've come back to again and again over the last year.

Being a waltz, the following pattern creates a very dance-like motion:

| (Beat) 1        | 2          | 3                         |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Soprano: melody | Bass: root | Tenor/Alto: rest of chord |

By pedaling into the subsequent bar, the melody is always a little bit ahead of the counterpoint.

At certain important moments——perhaps at the beginning of a section——the root can sound simultaneously with the melody, to signal an "arrival".

At this moment it seems that this would be a beautiful style to master.
