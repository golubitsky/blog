It turns out the same octatonic scale can be played over both tritone substitutions, but it sounds better over the ♭II than over the V.

2-5-1:

- descending thirds
- 4 different thirds for each of the 2 and 5 (tritone sub: ♭II)
- first third starting on the 9 of the 2, outlining a major 7 built on the m7th of that 2
- first 3rd on the ♭II comes from dropping the top note of the preceding major third
- down the octatonic scale from there
- on the 1, a nice sound is the Major 7 + ♯11, in other words a major II chord over the major I7 chord
  - Voicing: The M2/P4/M3 construction built on the 5th of the I

All 12 keys!

Today walked in the sun, one of those rare crisp days. [Roy Hargrove — Strasbourg / St. Denis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM83V4BD1Bw). There was another day in the past, in Fall, in Powderhouse Park, when I learned he had died.
