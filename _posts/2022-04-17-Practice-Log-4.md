Going off of the vamp in the coda of _Naima_ (see [yesterday's post]({{ "/2022/04/16/Practice-Log-3" | relative_url }})), I practiced each of the

- major 7 chords
  - easiest
- dominant 7 chords
  - second-easiest
- minor 7 chords
  - a little tougher, but fairly quick reaction time
- half-diminished 7 chords
  - hardest; slowest reaction time; need to come back to this!
- I should go through [all the other qualities]({{ "/2022/02/06/Atomic-elements-of-improvisation" | relative_url }}); for example, the `major 7 +5` from the most "out" chord in _Naima_ would be interesting..

in 5-note close position voicings, around the circle of fifths — playing an arpeggio of such voicings for every root and chord quality (e.g., for `C△`, `C E G B C`, `E G B C E`, `G B C E G`, `B C E G B`). Being that 7th chords have 4 distinct voices, this voicing always doubles the outer voices, with three inner voices.

The "all-white" chords (i.e., `F△`, `C△`, `Em7`, `Am7`, `Dm7`, `G7`, `Bø`) are particularly tough.

Going up the arpeggios there is a sort of alternating pattern between `2 LH fingers + 3 RH fingers` and `3 LH fingers + 2 RH fingers` — but the the simplest fingering is not always strictly alternating.

## Warmup

Chromatic scale, 4 octaves. One voice each in left and right hands. In `M2`, `m3`, `P4`, `TT`, `P5`, `m6`, `M6`, `m7`, `M7`, octave.. etc. up to two octaves.

I suppose there's no reason to omit the `m2`, but the fingering is tough.

## Bach

I met Evan and Dan at Haymarket Cafe. Dan said his favorite composer is Bach; that his music is perfect. I said that listening to Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier I have the experience where every chord is "perfect" and then there is _one_ that is like 200 years ahead of its time. Dan suggested that Bach had put those in on purpose — Dan's teacher had told him that apparently Bach had thought that G-d is perfect and that to make perfect music would be an affront (or similar, or worse) to G-d, and so he had intentionally introduced imperfections into his music (so this story goes).

I couldn't find evidence of this on the internet, but I did find this quote (though never attributed to any particular letter or source):

> In Bach, the vital cells of music are united as the world is in God.

—Gustav Mahler
