My response, in a chat:

brisk, crisp, windy, dry, slightly chilly, sunny, partly cloudy, fall days  
Strasbourg / St. Denis by Roy Hargrove  
it's so beautiful  
RIP to that man  
died too young  
i love when i am exposed to a concept that feels like it draws a new connection for me between other things i've known before  
i can't think of an example  
some kind of insight that enriches my view of the world  
i love the desert night sky sparkling with stars so intensely, how we never see it most of the time  
i love you for asking me this question, for how much i want to find those things i truly love and tell you them
for how it makes me cry  
there's something that is very hard for me to explain.. it has to do with my favorite composer.. Gustav Mahler  
he made incredible, powerful, complex, searching, human, dramatic, gentle, accepting music...  
i love to interact with a person as that real person not in a role, not in an act, directly with that specific person  
i love the old growth forests in california, so full of life  
i love the colorado mountains  
i love the great teachers  
i do love the piano
