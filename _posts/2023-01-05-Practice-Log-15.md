I observed some characteristics of moving from one major chord to another.

| M chord interval away | n shared chord tones | chord tone (from->to) |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| m2 up, M7 down        | 0                    |                       |
| M2 up, m7 down        | 0                    |                       |
| m3 up, M6 down        | 1                    | 5->3                  |
| M3 up, m6 down        | 1                    | 3->1                  |
| P4 up, P5 down        | 1                    | 1->5                  |
| TT up, TT down        | 0                    | move m2,M2,m3 away    |
| P5 up, P4 down        | 1                    | 5->1                  |
| m6 up, M3 down        | 1                    | 1->3                  |
| M6 up, m3 down        | 1                    | 3->5                  |
| m7 up, M2 down        | 0                    |                       |
| M7 up, m2 down        | 0                    |                       |

There are two "cells" of chords:

- no common tones (+/-m2, +/-M2, TT)
  - each of these can be alternated with the 1 chord to walk up the inversions
  - creates synthetic scales
- with common tones (+/-m2, +/-M2, TT)

Again, this is only considering the major chords.
