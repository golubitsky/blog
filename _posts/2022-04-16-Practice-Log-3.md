[Naima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPAC6zt_1ZM), from [Giant Steps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Steps).

While listening, I wondered — what if Bill Evans had played this piece? I couldn't find recordings. Wynton Kelly was the pianist on the original recording (linked above).

A harmonic analysis of the whole recording. Subtlety abounds.

For voicings, in general, avoid 5ths — sometimes based on the pedal, and sometimes in the chords above (i.e. the ones before the "slash").

I tuned to `A=442`.

## Bars 1-8 (A section, [0:00](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=0))

Bass pedal on the dominant `E♭`. Even during the tonic `A♭` chords, the pedal persists.

### Bar 1

Melody starts on the `13` of `E♭ sus 13` — a `C`.

### Bar 2

Melody moves (down a 5th) to the `9` of `E♭ minor 9` — an `F`.

It is crucial to avoid the 5th of the chord (the `B♭`).

### Bar 3

#### Beats 1 and 2

If the pedal weren't there, this would be an `A major 7` chord, with the melody playing the major 7 - a `G♯`.

But the `E♭` pedal _is_ there.

`E♭ Locrian` scale (based on the 7th degree of the `E major scale`) contains both the `A major 7` _and_ the `E♭` pedal. It makes sense that it's a weird one, because this is a weird sound.

So this ends up being an `E♭ half-diminished 7`.

#### Beats 3 and 4

We are closer to resolution — the chord is again built on the pedal `E♭`, it's hard to hear the exact voicing, but since a `C` clashes with the voicing, I hear this is _not_ an `E♭ half-whole octatonic scale`. Instead, it's built on the `E melodic minor scale`.

And so this _must_ be an `E♭ dominant 7 alt`, with the melody sounding the `♯9` (`F♯`) and the `1` (`E♭`).

What makes it really hard to hear is the continued `E♭ pedal` with the really close piano voicings — just 3 notes each, all using the same `m2 M3` voicing:

- Bar 3 (beats 1 and 2): `G♯ A C♯`
- Bar 3 (beats 3 and 4): `F♯ G B` — this voicing is essential to the sound
- Bar 4: `G A♭ C`

##### Tonal gravity tangent

Another way to think of these first three/four chords is as `pedal + major 7 chord with root an interval above the pedal)`: where the intervals are, respectively `m7`, `m3`, `TT`.

However if we ignore the pedal altogether, what emerges is root motion as two sets of `major 7` chords moving with tonal gravity (this is no longer _complete_ support of the melody of _Naima_ on that second half of Bar 3, but it's close): `D♭△ G♭△ A△ D△` — this kind of "wants" to resolve to a `D♭△` (not to the `A♭△` in _Naima_).

This also sounds an awful lot like the whole-tone/thirds/Giant Steps situation...

### Bar 4

A simple `A♭ major 7` — the pedal resolves, and the melody is the `5`, an `E♭` — incidentally, what _was_ the pedal!

### Bar 5 - 8

Repeat bars 1 - 4.

## Bars 9-16 (B Section, [0:32](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=32))

Bass pedal on the `B♭`, a 5th up from the first 8 bars — against tonal gravity.

### Bar 9

Melody starts on the root `1` of a `B♭ sus ♭9`. It comes from the `III` Phrygian mode of `G♭ major scale`.

Else, it is simply a `B major 7` over a `B♭` — hence the suggested `sus`pensions — of the `♭9 -> 1` and `4 -> 3` and `♭6 -> 5` — it's basically the most suspended chord relative to the `B♭` major chord whose root is the pedal.

But I think given that this recording is post-_Kind of Blue_ it is safe to assume that Coltrane must have been leaning towards the modal analysis.

### Bar 10

`G major 6` over the continued pedal `B♭`. The added `6` makes a tritone with the pedal, which can't be ignored (the sound isn't quite _Naima_ without it). It would be hard to find this chord "naturally" — but it's there, in this piece.

Melody goes — from the root of the pedal in bar 9 — to the root of the "over" chord — the `G`.

How to analyze it/name the chord (other than as a "slash" chord)? This is a diminished harmony, based on the symmetric octatonic scale — the `G half-whole octatonic scale` is one such scale. It seems more fruitful to analyze it in that scale than to find a name for it within traditional harmony. But then Coltrane was playing on the edge of traditional harmony and modal harmony during this period. In any case, it's certainly an off-color sound.

### Bars 11 - 12

Repeat bars 9 and 10.

### Bar 13

`B♭ alt 7` — clearly over the `B minor melodic scale` — the most "out", the most "dissonant" sound of this piece — the melody is on the `♯9`, the `D♭`.

### Bar 14

Continued `B♭ sus ♭9`, but melody goes down a minor 3rd to the `B♭`, either 1) `major 7` of the `B` or 2) root of the pedal `B♭` or 3) `3` of the underlying `G♭ major scale`.

### Bar 15

Melody goes down a minor third to the `13` of `B♭ sus 13` — a `G`. Sounds analogous to bar 1, but a 5th up — this is _much_ less dissonant compared to where we came from — almost a "home" sound, except a 5th up.

### Bar 16

Melody goes down a major third to `E♭` — our friend, the pedal from Bars 1 - 8.

At first I thought this was an `E△/B♭`, but there is clearly _no_ `B` in the recording.

What it sounds most like, is the "A" position rootless voicing construction (see _Appendix_ below) that forms a `B♭ half-diminished 7`, with the melody on the `11` of that chord.

Not only is that `11` _the `E♭` pedal from Bars 1 - 8_, but this half-diminished 7 _appears_ to function as "dominant" to the upcoming `E♭ sus 13` — which of course is _not_ the tonic — the eventual tonic that we will get to, only at the last measure (following in the footsteps of _Tristan und Isolde_), is `A♭`! And so, this chord _can_ be thought of as the `ii half-diminished 7` leading to the `V sus 13` leading to the `I major seven`! Eureka. The scale is the `II` of the `D♭ melodic minor scale`.

On another hand, even though there is no `B` in the sound, the `A♭ harmonic minor scale` could also work here?

### Scales used in B Section

To recap, the scales used in the `B section` — all with a `B♭` pedal:

- Bars 9/11: B♭ phrygian (G♭ major)
- Bars 10/12: G half-whole octatonic scale
- Bar 13: B♭ altered/diminished whole-tone (B melodic minor)
- Bar 14: B♭ phrygian (G♭ major)
- Bar 15: B♭ mixolydian (E♭ major)
- Bar 16: D♭ melodic minor (_or_ A♭ harmonic minor?)

## Bars 17 - 20 (A section recap, [1:05](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=65))

A shortened recap of the A section, as one 4-bar repetition.

## Bars 21 - 40 (Piano solo over AABA, [1:22](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=82))

Piano solo over bars 1 - 20.

## Bars 41 - 48 (B section, [2:46](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=166))

## Bars 49 - 52 (A section, [3:21](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=201))

A shortened recap of the A section, as one 4-bar repetition.

Some differences? TODO: compare against the Eb sharp 9.. could it be be a G major 7 over Eb earlier (above) ?

## Bars 53 - 56 (Pre-coda, [3:38](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=218))

Repeat bars 51 and 52 twice. (This would be another `A section` but the first 2 bars are subbed out for the last 2 bars)

## Bars 57 - 61 (Coda, [3:55](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=235))

Repeat bars 51 and 52 _a third time_...

But, instead of ending on the `I` in bar 58, begin an ascent in the melody where each note lasts 2 beats, up the `A♭` major scale: `E♭ F G A♭ B♭ C` until finally ending on the `E♭` in Bar 61.

Over this ascent starting on bar 58, the chords vamp, alternating every two beats between `A♭ major 7` and the dominant `E♭ sus 13` until finally, in bar 61, the pedal drops out, there is only the `A♭ major 7` with the melody holding a fermata on the `Eb` — the `5` — what _had been_ the pedal.

That vamp at the end is a really, really classic sound. Turns out we can walk up the mixolydian scale, alternating between the `I` and `V`:

| Scale Degrees | Chord    | Chord degrees |
| :------------ | -------- | ------------- |
| `5 7 1 3 5`   | `I△`     |               |
| `6 1 3 4 6`   | `Vsus13` | `2 4 6 7 9`   |
| `7 1 3 5 7`   | `I△`     |
| `1 3 4 6 1`   | `Vsus13` | `4 6 7 9 11`  |
| `2 3 5 7 2`   | `I△9`    |
| `3 4 6 1 3`   | `Vsus13` | `6 7 9 11 13` |
| `4 6 1 2 4`   | `Vsus`   | `7 9 11 5 7`  |
| `5 7 1 3 5`   | `I△`     |

The coda of _Naima_ is essentially this scale, omitting the 4th scale degree chord.

# Appendix: "A" and "B" position voicings

Mark Levine, in the _The Jazz Piano Book_ (bottom of p. 46) refers to the following voicings of dominant 7 chords (and this is how I was taught by [Anthony Mele](https://www.uml.edu/fahss/music/faculty/mele-anthony.aspx)):

- "A" position: `7 9 3 13`
- "B" position: `3 13 7 9`

Within traditional harmony, these voicings fruitfully apply to at least two other root notes, where the "A" voicing is built on some interval above the root:

- "A" voicing `m7` above the root forms a `dominant 7` — based on the root — using the mixolydian scale — chord tones `7 9 3 13`.
- "A" voicing `TT` above the root forms a `half-diminished 7` — based on mel. minor scale starting `m3` _above_ the root - chord tones `♭5 7 1 11`
- "A" voicing `m3` above the root forms a `minor 6 (major 7)` — based on mel. minor scale starting on the root — chord tones `♭3 5 6 9`
- "A" voicing `m2` above the root forms a `sus flat 9` — based on mel. minor scale `M2` _below_ the root — chord tones `♭9 11 5 1`
