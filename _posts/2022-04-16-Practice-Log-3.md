[Naima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPAC6zt_1ZM), from [Giant Steps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Steps).

While listening, I wondered — what if Bill Evans had played this piece? I couldn't find recordings. Wynton Kelly was the pianist on the original recording (linked above).

An harmonic analysis of the whole recording.

## Bars 1-8 (A section, [0:00](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=0))

Bass pedal on the dominant `E♭`. Even during the tonic `A♭` chords, the pedal persists.

### Bar 1

Melody starts on the `13` of `E♭ sus 13` — a `C`.

### Bar 2

Melody moves (down a 5th) to the `9` of `E♭ minor 9` — an `F`.

### Bar 3

#### Beats 1 and 2

If the pedal weren't there, this would be an `A major 7` chord, with the melody playing the major 7 - a `G♯`.

But the `E♭` pedal _is_ there.

Another way to think of these first three chords is as `pedal + major 7 chord with root an interval above the pedal)`: where the intervals are, respectively `m7`, `m3`, `TT`; or even more simply, a major chord in all cases, with the melody playing the major 7.

In this way — disregarding the pedal — the root motion for the first 4 bars is: `A♭: 4 ♭7 ♭2 5 1` or `E♭: ♭7 ♭3 ♭5 1; A♭: 1` — outlining/suggesting the chords `E♭ half diminished` and `A♭ major`.

But of course there's that pesky `E♭ dominant 7 alt` chord on Bar 3 beats 3 and 4. If we ignore it, then the interesting pattern of tonal gravity emerges (this is no longer complete support of the melody of _Naima_ on that second half of Bar 3, but it's close): `D♭△ G♭△ A△ D△ A♭△`. There are now two groups of tonal gravity motion, and all the chords are major 7 chords.

#### Beats 3 and 4

We are closer to resolution — the chord is finally built on the pedal `E♭`, it's hard to hear the exact voicing, but it's an `E♭ dominant 7 alt`, with the melody sounding the `♯9` (`F♯`), with perhaps a `♭9` also present, I can't decide.

TODO: there's question about this chord. Note the other TODO below. Could it be a major 7 construction over the `E♭` (as also alluded to above)?

### Bar 4

A simple `A♭ major 7` — the pedal resolves, and the melody is the `5`, an `E♭` — incidentally, what _was_ the pedal!

### Bar 5 - 8

Repeat bars 1 - 4.

## Bars 9-16 (B Section, [0:32](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=32))

Bass pedal on the `B♭`, a 5th up from the first 8 bars — against tonal gravity.

### Bar 9

Melody starts on the root `1` of a `B♭ sus ♭9`.

This chord can be analyzed as the `III` chord on the Phrygian mode of `G♭`.

Else, it is simply a `B major 7` over a `B♭` — hence the suggested `sus`pensions — of the `♭9 -> 1` and `4 -> 3` and `♭6 -> 5` — it's basically the most suspended chord relative to the `B♭` major chord whose root is the pedal.

### Bar 10

`G major 6` over the continued pedal `B♭`. The added `6` makes a tritone with the pedal, which can't be ignored (the sound isn't quite _Naima_ without it). It would be hard to find this chord "naturally" — but it's there, in this piece.

Melody goes — from the root of the pedal in bar 9 — to the root of the "over" chord — the `G`.

How to analyze it/name the chord (other than as a "slash" chord)? It's not easy. It fits into no major or minor scale. If anything, it is a diminished harmony, based on the symmetric octatonic scale — the `B♭ half-whole octatonic scale` is one such scale. It seems more fruitful to analyze it in that scale than to find a name for it within traditional harmony. But then Coltrane was playing on the edge of traditional harmony and modal harmony during this period. In any case, it's certainly an off-color sound.

### Bars 11 - 12

Repeat bars 9 and 10.

### Bar 13

Like bar 9, `B♭ sus ♭9`, but melody is on the `D♭` — either the 1) `9` of the `B` or 2) `♭3` of the pedal `B♭`, or — perhaps this makes the most sense 3) `5` of the underlying `G♭ major scale`.

### Bar 14

Continued `B♭ sus ♭9`, but melody goes down a minor 3rd to the `B♭`, either 1) `major 7` of the `B` or 2) root of the pedal `B♭` or 3) `3` of the underlying `G♭ major` scale.

### Bar 15

Melody goes down a minor third to the `13` of `B♭ sus 13` — a `G` (sounds analogous to bar 1, but a 5th up)

This is _close_ to the chord from bar 10, but it's not the same.

### Bar 16

Melody goes down a major third to `E♭` — our friend, the pedal from Bars 1 - 8.

If the `B♭` pedal weren't there, this would be an `E major 7` (analogous to bar 3, beats 1 and 2, but a 5th up), with the melody playing the major 7 - a `D♯`. But the `B♭` pedal _is_ there, and so, again, I don't know how to name this chord if not as the "slash" chord `E△7/B♭`.

## Bars 17 - 20 (A section recap, [1:05](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=65))

A shortened recap of the A section, as one 4-bar repetition.

## Bars 21 - 40 (Piano solo over AABA, [1:22](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=82))

Piano solo over bars 1 - 20.

## Bars 41 - 48 (B section, [2:46](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=166))

## Bars 49 - 52 (A section, [3:21](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=201))

A shortened recap of the A section, as one 4-bar repetition.

Some differences? TODO: compare against the Eb sharp 9.. could it be be a G major 7 over Eb earlier (above) ?

## Bars 53 - 56 (Pre-coda, [3:38](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=218))

Repeat bars 51 and 52 twice. (This would be another `A section` but the first 2 bars are subbed out for the last 2 bars)

## Bars 57 - 61 (Coda, [3:55](https://youtu.be/bPAC6zt_1ZM?t=235))

Repeat bars 51 and 52 _a third time_...

But, instead of ending on the `I` in bar 58, begin an ascent in the melody where each note lasts 2 beats, up the `A♭` major scale: `E♭ F G A♭ B♭ C` until finally ending on the `E♭` in Bar 61.

Over this ascent starting on bar 58, the chords vamp, alternating every two beats between `A♭ major 7` and the dominant `E♭ sus 13` until finally, in bar 61, the pedal drops out, there is only the `A♭ major 7` with the melody holding a fermata on the `Eb` — the `5` — what _had been_ the pedal.

# Coda: reflections

That vamp at the end is a really, really classic sound. Turns out we can walk up the mixolydian scale, alternating between the `I` and `V`:

| Scale Degrees | Chord    | Chord degrees |
| :------------ | -------- | ------------- |
| `5 7 1 3 5`   | `I△`     |               |
| `6 1 3 4 6`   | `Vsus13` | `2 4 6 7 9`   |
| `7 1 3 5 7`   | `I△`     |
| `1 3 4 6 1`   | `Vsus13` | `4 6 7 9 11`  |
| `2 3 5 7 2`   | `I△9`    |
| `3 4 6 1 3`   | `Vsus13` | `6 7 9 11 13` |
| `4 6 1 2 4`   | `Vsus`   | `7 9 11 5 7`  |
| `5 7 1 3 5`   | `I△`     |

The coda of _Naima_ is essentially this scale, omitting the 4th scale degree chord.

## Coltrane Substitutions

_Countdown_ and _Giant Steps_ sound very similar. See also: [Coltrane Substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coltrane_changes#Coltrane_substitution).
