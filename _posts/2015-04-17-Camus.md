Facing so much rejection these days in the job search. Just gotta pick up the pieces and morale the troops. Ish. Funny enough I was reading some existential literature (essays by Camus) as my morale picked up again. So many high and lows. I was thinking as I walked thru the downtown SF streets energetically back to my computer to send some more applications how I just haven't felt like I'm moving. That's ultimately why I did this whole thing — moved from LA, left "comfort," whatever it is that I've done and ended up in this job-searching state. I met someone on the street the other day who told me that those existential-isms are to be read with humor. I had never bumped into the term "absurd" in the arts before other than from A.J. Soprano's lips, and so that was all I could think of as I found the source in Camus' essays. Life _is_ absurd! Haha. Camus wrote about Nietzsche also — answering a question I had often posed in the past ("who came after Nietzsche, or carried his mantle?" — the question meaning not "in time" but just who faced N's questions and went further, and where?) — but this time I sort of laughed at the literature-on-paper aspect of it all. Gotta send a few more applications. And learn some stuff. Move!
