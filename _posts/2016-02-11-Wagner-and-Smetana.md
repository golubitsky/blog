The Flying Dutchman Overture, written by Wagner circa 1839, vs the last of Smetana's Ma Vlast. Smetana lifted soooo much from Wagner in this piece! Particularly the climactic sections â€” where it "comes together." Awesome. I had to google who came first, and of course it was Wagner, by some 40 years.
