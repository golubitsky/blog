title: Where is the Love?
---

Phineas Newborn Jr.'s cover of [Where is the Love](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Is_the_Love_(Roberta_Flack_and_Donny_Hathaway_song)>) spans the gamut; some parts remind me of the passion and epicness of [Eb major section of Rachmaninoff's Prelude in G minor](https://youtu.be/d9UCBtleQO0?t=42). Also I am inspired by the _hint_ of a smirk on an otherwise serious expression as he performs the piece (link below).

- Original: [Roberta Flack And Donny Hathaway - Where Is The Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBT1neIA0tc) — as Barry Harris (R.I.P.)emphatically intoned — one has to know the _songs_ — otherwise they will not "sing"!

Reminds of another:

- Cover: [Christian Sands - Can't Find My Way Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFIvHgUpnqo)
- Original: [Blind Faith - Can't Find My Way Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU6iplEflzs)
- My cover: I haven't gotten to that one yet. :)

Speaking of "epicness" — the turn of phrase that I thought recently was "epically elegant", with respect to Chopin's [Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. posth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hyAOYMUVDs). I heard it while listening to Chopin in the background. At some point during this piece, whatever I was doing became background. Chopin demanded to be heard.
