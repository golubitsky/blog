The "fiery" part of Newborn's rendition:

    Fmaj7 Gbmaj7 Dbmaj7 Gmin11 C7

Walking tenths from V7 to I, two voices (M or m is short for M10 or m10):

    up: M on 5, m on 6, m on 7, m on M7, M on 1
    down: (pickup m on 6) M on 5, M on 4, m on 3, m on 2, M on 1

On the way down he does a little loop-di-loop trill (both voices same rhythm)x from 5->6->5, before descending. Could just practice scales in 10ths.

Amazing, gotta listen to more Newborn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cuk7_9l9lc
