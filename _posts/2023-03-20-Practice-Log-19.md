Today, continued practicing of the `iii V/iii ii V` turnaround, now in F.

Left hand holding down the stride pattern — root on the downs 3rd and 7th on the ups. Right improvising on the arpeggios. Diminished arpeggios over the two dominant chords; different versions of the two minor chords. Up and down, start on different chord tones.

I'm reminded of Barry Harris saying "the way you learn jazz is by practicing all the boring stuff you don't want to practice". And of Bill Evans — always according to a system.

Music of patterns. At first something small. One doesn't start with massive symphonies. Although my single greatest inspiration musically is Gustav Mahler, who wrote the most epic symphonies. One has to start with small patterns, and create aesthetically pleasing combinations of them; ones that are meaningful and express a deep, inner sense of congruence and peace.
