title: The Buddhist Tradition (3)
---

I continued to read from _The Buddhist Tradition: In India, China and Japan_ edited by William Theodore de Bary, once again at lunch; once again a page or two at a time.

I read a few verses from the [Dhammapada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammapada), sometimes translated as _The Way of Truth_. It is a collection of sayings attributed to the Buddha. The particular passage I read from is introduced by the editor as a precursor (or at least as rather similar) to the Christian idea of "turning the other cheek."

The translation reads:

> Never in the world is hate
> <br>Appeased by hatred.
> <br>It is only appeased by love—
> <br>This is an eternal law.

"Eternal law" here is a translation of the term _Sanatana dharma_, which appears to mean something like "duty inherent to all things" and is a core Hindu concept, here (noted by the editor) redefined in terms of Buddhist ethics.

However, the verse that really caught my attention was the following one. The biggest reason for this is Mahler. [Recently]({{ "/2021/03/18/Worlds-Colliding" | relative_url }}) I thought about Mahler, classical music, triumph, tragedy, and acceptance: his music ends<sup>1</sup> on a serene acceptance that is decidedly neither triumphant nor tragic (though both of the latter occur extensively throughout his symphonies).

And so, as I read the following translation, I experienced déjà vu; I had encountered in text what had been expressed within the Western classical music tradition by this culminating composer — a translation of a 2600-year-old idea:

> Victory breeds hatred
> <br>For the defeated lie down in sorrow.
> <br>Above victory or defeat
> <br>The calm man dwells in peace.

### A few other translations

A few more translations of this Verse 201 from the Dhammapada:

- [Translated by Daw Mya Tin, M.A.][1]
- [Translated by Sangharakshita][2]
- [compiled and published by Ven. Weragoda Sarada Maha Thero of the Singapore Buddhist Meditation Centre.][3]

<sup>1</sup> What does it mean, for it to end? The last thing he wrote? He was still writing music as he died — there is the unfinished 10th. However, the 9th symphony, and particularly its finale, is what I consider to be the "end." I have felt the intuition that the part of the 10th that _is_ finished (the first movement), as lyrical and melodically flowing as it is at parts — — it almost feels like the most flowing, expansive, _believable_ romanticism ever written — as well as striking in its atonal, clustered passage of sheer terror — that it somehow is — _beyond_ the "end." And it is unfinished after all. Nevertheless, it's pretty awesome to encounter this first movement of the 10th and to realize that after all, the 9th wasn't a _true_ "end" after — _all_. Life went on, even after that "acceptance," if only for a little while. Come to think of it, maybe there's no other way. If there really _were_ an end, it might become a "triumph" — the defeated would lie down in sorrow...
