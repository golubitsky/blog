## [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
This library builds on Matplotlib to provide a higher-level language to quickly create all sorts of statistical plots. We can use `load_dataset` to quickly load any of [these datasets](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data) to mess around with. [Matplotlib colormaps](https://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html) can be entered into `palette` arguments to change the color schemes.
	
### [Distribution Plots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/distributions.html)
* [distplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.distplot.html) plots histogram for single quantitative variable, also by default (`kde=True`) plots the [Kernel Density Estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) (KDE)

* [jointplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.jointplot.html) plots histogram of each of two quantitative variables and their combined scatter plot; also supports linear regression (`kind='reg'`)

* [pairplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html) plots pairwise relationships across entire dataframe for all quantitative variables; supports `hue` argument for categorical variables

* [rugplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.rugplot.html) - plots dashmark for every point in a univariate distribution; can be used to build the KDE (the summation of a normal distribution curve at every point in the rugplot)

### [Categorical Plots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/categorical.html)
* [barplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.barplot.html)  aggregates a quantitative variable `y` for each value of a categorical variable `x` based on some function, by default the mean 

* [countplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.countplot.html) plots a barplot of the count of the number of occurrences of each value of a categorical variable `x`

* [boxplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html) plots the distribution for some quantitative variable `y` for each value of a categorical variable `x`; each such distribution can be split by another categorical variable using `hue=z`; can also show distributions for each quantitative variable in dataframe by omitting `x` and `y`; the box plus the two whiskers show the four quartiles of the distribution, outliers are points outside the whiskers

* [violinplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.violinplot.html) same idea & usage as boxplot but plots the kernel density estimation of the data's underlying distribution; when using `hue` can also use `split=True` for "a single violin" comprised of the `x` and `hue`d variables (rather than two symmetrical, side-by-side violins)

* [stripplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.stripplot.html) a scatterplot where one variable is categorical (rather than both quantitative); can use `jitter=True` to de-overlap the stacked dots nearer the mode(s); often used as overlap of violin plot for more detail

* [swarmplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.swarmplot.html) similar to stripplot but points are adjusted toward the shape of a violin plot; doesn't scale well to big datasets

* [factorplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.factorplot.html) the most general categorical plot; takes in a `kind` parameter to build any of these plots: `{ point, bar, count, box, violin, strip }`

### Matrix Plots
* [heatmap](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html) - display color-encoding of data already in matrix form; useful for displaying correlations `sns.heatmap(df.corr())` 

* [clustermap](http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.clustermap.html) - hierarchically-clustered heatmap, computationally intensive

### Grids
* [PairGrid](http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.PairGrid.html) the general case of pairplot; can use `map`, `map_diag`, `map_upper`, and `map_lower` to customize what kind of graph appears in each cell in the grid

* [FacetGrid](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.FacetGrid.html) plots a single (or multiple, as in scatter) quantitative variable by categorical "facets" to explore relationships between the categorical variables and the quantitative variables; this plots the histograms (distributions) of ages for males and females:  

		sns.FacetGrid(titanic, col='sex')
           .map(plt.hist, "age")

### [Regression](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/regression.html)
* [lmplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.lmplot.html) (linear model plot) plots scatter plot with linear regression; takes in `x,y, data`
