I've been thinking about my overall strategy for learning machine learning and this led to googling "machine learning curriculum." I first discovered [Karl Rosaen's blog](http://karlrosaen.com/ml/); he had also quit his job to embark on a learning sabbatical. Incidentally I am taking the same Statistics MOOC as he mentions in his "Phase 1." He wrote
> Having the goal of "learning machine learning" is daunting.

> Each phase should include at least one track that builds practical skills and one track focused on theoretical foundations.

The first quote above is what sent me a-googling. The second also makes sense to me and indeed the Stanford MOOC and the Udemy Python/ML course have been complementing nicely. I also noted that his "Phase 1" took him 5 months to complete. I've been wondering how long the Statsprob course will take, so this is one data point. I intend to complete it sooner than that. He also wrote 
> Additionally, it's always worth surveying the field at your current level of fluency to be on the look out for the next phase of studies and to continue to build a mental map of interconnected topics that may be prerequisites for the techniques and applications that you find most exciting.

Finally, I found this quote enlightening and similarly in accord with my approach:

>Using fancy tools like neural nets, boosting, and support vector machines without understanding basic statistics is like doing brain surgery before knowing how to use a band-aid.
