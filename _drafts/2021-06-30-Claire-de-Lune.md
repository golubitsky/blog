It means "Moonlight," as I learned just now. Which makes a lot of sense. I've been practicing the piece little by little for a few weeks now. Debussy used the piano beautifully in all registers. For example, there are some sections of only very high notes, in a register where I might not normally play, but he shows beauty in that register. In the 2 octaves above middle C, I have discovered that the piano has a very bell-like sound, particularly when letting the notes ring above the lush, lyrical tapestry of the middle section. These bells make me think of the glory of, for example, church bells, and then I think of shafts of light — which is why, now, the meaning of the title makes sense to me.

There is much beauty in this piece, and it is a joy (and a challenge) to practice it. At times I can't help but think that Bill Evans had been here. For example, the "So What" chord is heard in passing, and generally many of the voicings anticipate his work.

I was lucky enough to hear Thomas Stumpf perform Chopin's _Ballad in G minor_ at Tufts University a couple years ago. What struck me about his performance was the unflinching, unceremonious, the simply.. fast.. way in which he performed the whole piece, but in particular the _Presto con fuoco_ (meaning "really fast, with fire") section at the very end. There was just something heroic about it; like he was putting everything into the performance, lighting all the fireworks left. I remember a similar experience when, during the year of Mozart's 250th birthday, I heard him play Mozart's _Piano Sonata No. 8 in A minor_ — the piece Mozart wrote after his Mother had passed away (as he taught us).

Here I remember the _Ballad in G minor_ performance because it is interesting to listen to an (alleged) recording of [Debussy playing Clair de Lune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yri2JNhyG4k). As one of the commenters observed, "If it didn’t say Debussy played it everyone would be hating on the speed" — normally the piece is performed much more slowly, luxuriating in its light and colors.

And the transitions! Each is better than the last.
