# Random Variables
A random variable assigns a unique numerical value to the outcome of a random experiment. Values for random variables can be determined theoretically or observationally. Random variables can be
* **Discrete** -- *things we count*
  * values take on one of a finite set of values
  * can take on many values, in which case it's easier to treat them as continuous (like IQ, SAT score, salary) 
* **Continuous** -- *things we measure*
  * values take on one of an infinite set of values in an interval
  * can be "rounded" -- like time spent watching TV per week to nearest hour or weight to nearest pound -- but still continuous, though appearing to be discrete
