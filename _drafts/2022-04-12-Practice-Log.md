I continue to believe that it's the basics that matter. Recent discoveries:

### 2-5-1s in the left hand with bebop scale in the right hand

Any voicing will do.

Descending bebop (mixolydian) scale built on either (same, different ways of thinking):

- 4th/11th of the 2
- 5th of the 1

e.g., `e A7 D` + `1 7♯ 7 6 5 4 3 2 1` (descending) and `1 1♯ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8` (ascending)

e.g., G C F B♭

The classic [Gato Barbieri Fiesta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKxQcKwcxy4) starts with something like:
```
Dm7 G7 Emsus11 A7♭9
```

This is the same `e A d G`
