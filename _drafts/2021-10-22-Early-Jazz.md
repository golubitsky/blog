The other Sunday, I finally went to a [used bookstore in Montague](https://maq.ujw.mybluehost.me/) that I had been meaning to visit for a while. One of the several books that caught my attention is _Blues People: Negro Music in White America_, by LeRoi Jones; I've read a good portion of it. I had a cursory understanding of the history of Jazz as originating somehow as an amalgamation of African rhythms (brought over as a result of the slave trade) and the European musical tradition. I won't get into all the nuances of the history of black people in America that the author gets into; but I want to capture at least a framework of the history leading up to bebop jazz music.

### Blues

Blues music was born from the particular conditions of the enslavement of black people in America. They had been brought against their will to a land with a completely antithetical philosophy. "North American settlements were strictly economic enterprises... Life itself was of value—and could be made perfect." (p. 5) The notion of "performance" was not part of blues — this was a music that was born from the struggles of the enslaved black people.

After the Emancipation, many Negroes migrated to the cities of the North, in particl
- King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band ("the first really influential Negro jazz band in the North" p145) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE6HRi2E-dc
- Chicago Jazz Age (ended in 1920s)
- Bix Biederbiecke (musical interests included Debussy, Schoenberg, Stravinsky) vs Louis Armostrong (perfected the blues-influenced brass style in jazz)
  - rebellious/counter-culture vs pinnacle of his culture, yet both outside the mainstream
- Hot 5, ascendancy of the soloist (vs the earlier communal improvisation embodied by Oliver's band)
  - Influenced by Armstrong: Earl Hines (piano), Coleman Hawkins (tenor), Jimmy Harrison (trombone)
- Fletcher Henderson Orchestra - first big jazz band, included Armstrong, Don Redman (arranger, later bandleader)

  - "By 1930 every city outside the Deep South with a Negro population (1920 census) above sixty thousand except Philadelphia had produced an important band: Washington, Duke Ellington; Baltimore, Chick Webb; Memphis, Jimmie Lunceford; St. Louis, the Missourians; Chicago, Luis Russel and Armstrong; New York, Henderson, Charlie Johnson, and half a dozen more." (quote from Hsio Web Shih, _The Spread of Jazz and the Big Bands_)
  - "Between 1925 and 1935 they created, in competition, a musical tradition that required fine technique and musicianship (several of them were among the earliest virtuosi in jazz); they began to change the basis of the jazz reportory from blues to the wider harmonic possibilities of the thirty-two-bar song; they created a perfected the new ensemble-style big-band jazz; they kept their groups together for years, working until they achieved a real unity. They showed that jazz could absorb new, foreign elements without losing its identity, that it was in fact capable of evolution."

- Southwestern bands "remained much closer to the older blues tradition": Bennie Moten's from kansas City, Walter Page (and his Blue Devils) from Oklahoma City, Charlie Creath from St. Louis, and Troy Floyd from Texas.
  - "'Shouting' blues singers like Joe Turner and Jimmy Rushing first were heard literally screaming over the crashing rhythm sections and blarring brass sections." (p. 169)
    - "Wynonie Harris, Jimmy Witherspoon, Bullmoose Jackson, B. B. King were among the best and the most sophisticated of the shouters; the more 'primitive' school of shouters like Muddy Waters, T-Bone Walker, BoDiddley, Smokey Hogg seemed to bring a deeper knowledge of older blues forms into their music." (p.170)
    - "A singer like Lowell Fulson or Smokey Hogg was often recording simultaneously for half a dozen companies."
  - Led to "rhythm and blues" which was "largely rhythm units smashing away behind screaming blues singers."
  - Some of the first R&B recordings were by a veteran Cecil Gant(e.g. [I Wonder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHLqFFpnJiQ))

Count Basie's bands, of the "hard-swinging Southwestern blues tradition" and "less polished than the beautiful Ellington groups of the late thirties and early forties" had a huge impact on the bebop to come.

Gillespie influenced by Eldridge

Parker “innovator whose dynamic and uninhibited comprehension of Lester Young’s music made his own work possible” 193

Basie's efforts helped move jazz piano away from the older "stride" style with its heavy insistence on an almost guitar-like left hand. Later Earl Hines was able to develop a piano style utilizing the long, fluent "horn" line, which was developed even further by pianists like Teddy Wilson and Art Tatum, all preparing the way for Bud Powell and the rest of the bebop pianists. p. 197

First real bop orchestra: Billy Eckstine 1944, members over time included Miles Davis, Kenny Dorham, trumpets; Gene Ammons, Dexter Gordon, Lucky Thomspon, tenor saxophones; Charlie Parker, alto; Leo Parker, baritone; John Malachi, piano; Art Blakey, drums; Tommy Potter, bass, arrangements by Budd Johnson, Tadd Dameron, Jerry Valentine; Sarah Vaughan and Billy Exckstine, vocals. ... p199

- I am interested in the intersection between jazz and European "Classical" music, and this author offers an interesting perspective (of course, the blues is an essential precursor of jazz). Certainly I've heard in the past that "white people can't play the Blues, because it's a black music" — and there is clearly some truth to that — this author sketches a history where the Blues was a style born directly from the unique experience of a people transplanted into slavery in a completely foreign land. He claims quite a chunk of the glory of Jazz music for black people — going so far as to say that any music of any value that would come out of America is Black music to a great extent. An interesting point (from our perspective) was how the black slaves who were converted to Christianity had found a lot of parallels with the Biblical tribulations of the Hebrews, in particular, drawing inspiration from the crossing of the River Jordan. So I think overall the story is more nuanced. The author also sketches how some of the other early inspirations were black caricatures of white caricatures of black people — in the form of black minstrel bands modeling themselves on white minstrel bands who used "blackface" to make fun of black people.

The author mentions some of the earliest black Blues artists recorded after the revival of the recording industry after the Great Depression: Leroy Carr (here's the same tune In The Evening (When The Sun Goes Down) covered impeccably by Ray Charles — so you can tell that these guys are really old-school or classic — if they are covered by the musical giants — it's fascinating to learn of some of these threads just from the perspective of continuity), Jimmy Yancey (this How Long Blues so incredibly simple, yet somehow powerful), Cripple Clarence Lofton, Mead Mux Lewis, Montana Taylor, Albert Ammons, Pete Johnson, and Charlie Spand. The overall arc of the history is: slavery, yearning for return to Africa, emancipation, joblessness and difficulty in now facing the prospects of the American Dream (as opposed to during slavery, when all essentials had been provided by the Master), wanting to (yet continued difficulty to) assimilate in America, migration from the South to the Northern cities during industrialization (Ford was a huge employer of blacks particularly during WWI, when most white men had gone to war — and paid the very decent wage of "no less than $5 a day"), and then these first recording after the Great Depression — and that's as far as I got for now. He wrote this book in the 1960s and he goes all the way up to the "modern music" — which was incidentally the final heyday of "Jazz proper". Louis Armstrong is mentioned as the first great Jazz soloist, and the latter-day giants like John Coltrane and Miles Davis appear somewhere at the end of this book.

On this subject, another book I ordered is Early Jazz Vol. 1: Its Roots and Musical Development by Gunther Schuller — this was an eminent educator (in my limited understanding, perhaps approaching or on the level of Leonard Bernstein) who taught at New England Conservatory — I had met with his name previously, but a couple weeks ago I was at the cafe talking to what turned out to be a doctor who had treated this Gunther Schuller for some illness or maybe even done an operation on him, so I decided to get his book.

## Looking ahead

Certainly, this author's story is not the _whole_ story; but also almost certainly it feels like his story is not only authentic, but well-researched. In any case, I will continue to learn about this history -- already I have Gunther Schuller's _Early Jazz_ on the way (the eminent educator, in my estimation approaching the likes of Leonard Bernstein, who I've encountered in my music studies).

For me, counterpoint to all this is the perspective of both Bill Evans and in particular of Barry Harris who look back and aspire to the European tradition of improvised music in the time of Chopin and Bach and earlier, Barry Harris in particular says something to the effect of "it's not about playing Jazz, it's about playing beautiful music" in the same breath as "if Chopin and Bach and them guys were alive now, they wouldn't be playing other people's music, they'd be improvising" and Bill Evans of course has that quote that I love, "Jazz is a process, not a style".
