starting with a c major scale
flat 3 -> melodic minor
sharp 1 -> melodic minor

sharp 4 -> major
flat 7 -> major

sharp 5 -> "its own form"; third mode of that gives an interesting mode that can be used over the alt chord on the 3; simplest purest way to get to the alt chord
 - you get the minor third and an alt form

flat 6 is a mirror

"harmonic third" is that minor third

the "melodic minor cell" can start on the major 3 or the sharp 4

alt means those four notes (what I called "the melodic minor cell")


look for where the harmonic major is within the form you get from `major scale` + `sharp 5`
