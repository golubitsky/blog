## Consciousness is not independent

It comes about through the Chain of Causation, and can never arise without a cause.

Whatever form of consciousness arises from a condition is known by the name of that condition; this if it arises from the eye and from forms it is known as visual consciousness.

Four bases which support all organisms and beings, whether now existing or yet to be.

- Food
- Contact
- Cogitation
- Consciousness

All four derive and originate from craving.

Ignorance -> Psychic constructions -> consciousness -> physical form -> six senses -> contact -> sensation -> craving -> attachment -> becoming -> birth -> old age -> death -> grief, lamentation, sorrow, despair.

This can probably better be represented as a graph (with cycles).
