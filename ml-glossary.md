title: ML glossary

There may be other ML glossaries (e.g. [google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary)), but this one will be mine, for terms that I have encountered.
Sidenote: it's possible to sort HTML tables using [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html-table-auto-sort/bpgbkjehkeffmmjfmdlmjjlffgkdcljp/related?hl=en).
